/** 
Memory address base of the registers of the graphics subsystem 

The GFX subsystem has four layers: the framebuffer layer, two tile
layers and one sprite layer. The framebuffer layer is generated by
using a user-specified framebuffer memory region in PSRAM and
interpreting the bytes or nibbles in there as a 4- or 8-bit bitmap.
That data is then used verbatim as a graphics layer.

The tile layers work as follows. Every 64 bytes in the tile memory are
interpreted as an 16x16-pixel, 4-bit image known as a 'tile'. As the
tile memory is 16K, this means there is a total of 512 tiles. These tiles
are shared between the two tile layers and the sprite layer.

A tilemap is an 64x64 map of 9-bit indexes into the tile memory: it 
describes a 'virtual' (64*16)x(64x16)=1024x1024 bitmap. This 'virtual'
bitmap is then referred to when filling in the 'real' 480x32 layer that
goes to the LCD/HDMI: the pixel at (0,0) is looked up in the 'virtual'
bitmap at (x,y)=(GFX_TILEx_OFF.x,GF_TILEx_OFF.y). Then, for each increase
in X on the 'real' layer, (GFX_TILEx_INC_COL.x,GFX_TILEx_INC_COL.y) is 
added to the (x,y) coordinates, while for each increase in Y, 
(GFX_TILEx_INC_ROW.x,GFX_TILEx_INC_ROW.y) is added. Note that all these
values are specified in (1/64)th pixel, so e.g. to make the 'real' (0,0)
pixel map to the 'virtual' (10, 20) pixel, you would set 
GFX_TILEA_OFF to (640<<16)|1280.

Sprites are still a WiP, you can't use them yet.

A note on colors: When compositing the final layers, all tile / FB colors 
are looked up in the palette memory, resulting in a bunch of RGBA colors. These
are mixed according to their alpha values, so it's possible to create 
semitranslucent effects. When RGBA values need to be specified, (e.g. to
fill the palette memory), the fields are
[31:24]: Alpha value. 0xff is opaque, 0x0 is fully transparent
[23:16]: Red value
[15:8]: Green value
[7:0]: Blue value
