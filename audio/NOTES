## Architecture:

DAC just takes in 16 bits whenever it gets 'em

Oscillators can mix a few basic waveforms together with rough volume levels

EG + amplifier + oscillator = voice (for now.  consider a filter?)

mixer takes 8 voices, volumes, puts them out to the DAC

## TODOS

reconsider sample depth of the oscillators?  12 bit?
pulse-width mod
